This Windows Explorer extension adds "Copy To" and "Move To" to the end of a shell context menu. It will copy or move selected items to a specified folder.

Extract both installer.exe and extension.dll somewhere. I for example have it in 'c:\tools\copy-move-extension' folder. Run installer.exe to install or uninstall the extension.

Requires 64bit OS, Windows 7 and up. However I've developed this on Windows 10 and did not tested on anything else.
