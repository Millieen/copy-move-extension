This Windows Explorer extension adds "Copy To" and "Move To" to Shell's context menu to copy and move selected items respectfully.

Extract both installer.exe and extension.dll somewhere. I for example have it in 'c:\tools\copy-move-extension' folder. Run installer.exe to install or uninstall the extension.

Requires 64bit OS, Windows 7 and up. However I tested this only on Windows 10.
